!To verify BGP Neighbors
show bgp l2vpn evpn summary

!To check VTEPs
show nve peers !NOTE: compared to normal vxlan, nve peers should appear as the learntype of this nve is via Control Plane

!To show all the nves associated with VTEP. 
show nve vni

!To show the IP to MAC binding 
show ip arp suppression-cache detail

!TO show VXLAN to VNI Bindings
show vxlan

!To show all the mac-address that have been learned
show l2route evpn mac all

!Another way to see the mac-address to IP bindings
show l2route evpn mac-ip all

!How to see all the details in the BGP database
